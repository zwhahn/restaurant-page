    <div class="about">We are a cozy neighborhood cafe where community and flavor come together. 
        By day, we’re your go-to spot for rich, freshly brewed coffee, homemade pastries, and hearty brunch favorites 
        crafted with love. As the sun sets, our wood-fired oven takes center stage, serving up authentic Neapolitan pizza 
        with a perfectly blistered crust, paired with a curated selection of local craft beers. </div>

    <div class="about">Family-owned and operated, we take pride in sourcing fresh, local ingredients to bring you dishes that feel like home. 
        Whether you’re here for your morning pick-me-up or an evening out with friends, Aster Cafe is a place where every 
        visit feels like catching up with an old friend.</div>
